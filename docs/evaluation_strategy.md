# Deepfake Video Detector: Enhanced Evaluation and Testing Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for evaluating and testing the enhanced deepfake video detection model, covering performance metrics, testing protocols, robustness checks, and validation of XAI explanations. From Hasif's Workspace.

## 1. Performance Metrics

For evaluating our binary classification model (real vs. fake), we use comprehensive performance metrics calculated using libraries like `scikit-learn` based on the model's predictions on the test set.

### Core Metrics

#### Accuracy
- **Formula:** `(True Positives + True Negatives) / (Total Samples)`
- **Relevance:** Overall correctness of the model
- **Calculation:** `sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)`
- **Considerations:** Can be misleading with imbalanced datasets

#### Precision (for the 'fake' class)
- **Formula:** `True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)`
- **Relevance:** Proportion of videos flagged as 'fake' that are actually fake
- **Calculation:** `sklearn.metrics.precision_score(y_true, y_pred, pos_label=1)`
- **Importance:** High precision reduces false alarms

#### Recall (Sensitivity, True Positive Rate)
- **Formula:** `True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)`
- **Relevance:** Proportion of actual fake videos correctly identified
- **Calculation:** `sklearn.metrics.recall_score(y_true, y_pred, pos_label=1)`
- **Importance:** High recall ensures deepfakes are caught

#### F1-Score
- **Formula:** `2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`
- **Relevance:** Harmonic mean balancing precision and recall
- **Calculation:** `sklearn.metrics.f1_score(y_true, y_pred, pos_label=1)`
- **Use Case:** Particularly useful with uneven class distribution

#### AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)
- **Concept:** Plots True Positive Rate vs False Positive Rate at various thresholds
- **Relevance:** Threshold-independent measure of discriminative power
- **Calculation:** `sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score(y_true, y_pred_probabilities)`
- **Interpretation:** 0.5 = random guessing, 1.0 = perfect discrimination

#### Confusion Matrix
- **Components:** True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, False Negatives
- **Relevance:** Detailed breakdown of correct and incorrect classifications
- **Calculation:** `sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)`

### Advanced Metrics

#### Cohen's Kappa
- **Purpose:** Inter-rater reliability accounting for chance agreement
- **Calculation:** `sklearn.metrics.cohen_kappa_score(y_true, y_pred)`

#### Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)
- **Purpose:** Balanced measure for binary classification
- **Range:** -1 to +1 (0 = random prediction)
- **Calculation:** `sklearn.metrics.matthews_corrcoef(y_true, y_pred)`

#### Average Precision Score
- **Purpose:** Summary of precision-recall curve
- **Calculation:** `sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score(y_true, y_scores)`
